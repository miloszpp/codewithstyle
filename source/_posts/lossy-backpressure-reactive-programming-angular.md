After a long break, I've prepared a video for you! It's a new episode of the Reactive Programming in Angular video course. This time we will tackle backpressure - a technique of dealing with observable streams that produce events too fast. As usual, it's explained in a practical context. You will not only learn what it is but also how it can help you! Please let me know your thoughts about this episode in the comments!
