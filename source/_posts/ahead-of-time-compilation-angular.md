This week instead of a regular article I've decided to post a video recording of the talk I gave last week on Angular Warsaw meetup #14. It's about **Ahead Of Time compilation in Angular**. 

Learn how Angular works under the hood and how to significantly decrease the size of the bundle with your Angular application.Â Enjoy!
