Today I'd like to share with you something that I've been working on for some time - the first three episodes of my new **video course**. The course is dedicated to functional-reactive programming in Angular. There is a strong trend of adopting reactive programming in the front-end world. The Angular framework doesn't stay behind - it's API is full of `Observables`. However, I've noticed that many Angular programmers don't take advantage of this _reactiveness_ built into Angular. What's more, there aren't many examples available on the internet showing how to use reactive programming in Angular in more complex scenarios. This is why I decided to create this video course series. I present to you **Reactive Programming in Angular**. The course is available **for free** on [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/codewithstyleinfo)! So far I've recorded **three episodes** which you can find below. Subsequent episodes will be published on this blog, so stay tuned!

Part 1: Introduction

Part 3: Merge, MergeMap and Subjects
