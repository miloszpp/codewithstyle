I've just published the 7th episode of **Reactive Programming in Angular** course! We're moving on to the topic of reactive forms which are another piece of reactive API in Angular. In this video, I'm implementing a form auto-save mechanism. You can access the whole course from [here](https://codewithstyle.info/reactive-programming-rxjs-angular-video-course/).
