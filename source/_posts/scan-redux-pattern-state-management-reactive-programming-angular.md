I'm back from holiday and ready to publish the last episode of [Reactive Programming in Angular video series](https://codewithstyle.info/reactive-programming-rxjs-angular-video-course/)! 

In this last episode, I look at a very interesting topic of how RxJS can be used to implement a **state management** technique known from libraries such as Redux. As always, you'll learn it based on a practical use-case - building a **form undo mechanism**! I hope you've enjoyed the course and it made you interested in reactive programming.

**Let me know in comments** if there is a topic that I haven't covered that you'd like to watch a video about!
