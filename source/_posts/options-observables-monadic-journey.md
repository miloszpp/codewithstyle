Recently I had a chance to talk about monads at the amazing [WarsawJS Meetup](https://warsawjs.com/). Below you can find a recording of the session. Slides from the talk are available [here](https://miloszpp.github.io/warsawjs-slides-monads/). The talk is very much related to some content on the blog. Here is a list of posts about monads in JavaScript/TypeScript:

*   [Part 1: Maybe monad](https://codewithstyle.info/advanced-functional-programming-in-typescript-maybe-monad/)
*   [Part 2: Monads and generators](https://codewithstyle.info/advanced-functional-programming-typescript-monads-generators/)
